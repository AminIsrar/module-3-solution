					<p>
						The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red
						junglefowl. As one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a population of more
						than 19 billion in 2011, there are more chickens in the world than any other species of bird or
						domestic animal. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food, consuming both their meat
						and their eggs.
					</p>
					<p>
						Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in Southeast-, East-, and South Asia,
						but with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the
						Indian subcontinent. From India, the domesticated chicken was imported to Lydia in western Asia
						Minor, and to Greece by the fifth century BC. Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th
						century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come to Egypt from the land
						between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.
					</p>
					<p>
						"Chicken" originally referred to young domestic fowl. The species as a whole was then called
						domestic fowl, or just fowl. This use of "chicken" survives in the phrase "Hen and Chickens",
						sometimes used as a British public house or theatre name, and to name groups of one large and
						many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands). The word
						"chicken" is sometimes erroneously construed to mean females exclusively, despite the term "hen"
						for females being in wide circulation.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the Deep South of the United States chickens are also referred to by the slang term yardbird.
